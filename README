 Brief walkthrough of app design / choices made - Briefly explain your object oriented analysis and design
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 - I mainly used the MVC design pattern while building this project.
 - The main logic of the parsing the Flickr JSON feed can be seen in the MainController.java class. 

 - The way I designed this project is that I use an API layer that acts as barrier between the UI and the controller, here AppAPI.java is the layer at which all the communications go through.
 - The AppAPI is initialized as a Singleton instance in the Application class of the project, in this case the AppApplication.java class
 - In AppApplication class, the controllers and the API layers are initialized and the instance of this API later is exposed to the UI by getAPI() method.

 - The MainActvity requests for flickr feed via the API to the controller as appAPI.getMainController().fetchPost(); . The Feedback to the UI via listeners, in this case via MainControllerListener interface.
 - The paging logic is in line 36 of MainActivity.class
 - I implemented the native Filterable interface for the search functionality. In RecyclerViewAdapter.java class The TitleFilter class has the filter based on Flickr post title.
